                                        Life before COVID had its ups and downs. When COVID hit it felt like everything in every direction was about to catch on fire, or already had. COVID radically reshaped 
                                        livelihoods, the way we all did things, as well as perspectives, and the way we all viewed things. The fatalities of this era will forever be remembered and cherished 
                                        for the passion, grace, joy and hope those souls brought to the people in their lives.

                                        we all cherish. Our catalog aims to unveil the silver-lining beneath the tragic effects of this era. By following students, experts, artists, 
                                        histories, simple pleasures, and even entertainment, we’ll bring to light how us humans got along and got through. We’ve put together a variety of 
                                        illustrations, reports, social perspectives, animations and more to capture the thoughts and feelings which convey this silver-lining. 
                                        Life as it is understood by a diversity of individuals is both reflected on and enjoyed uniquely by all. </p>

                                        This catalog is not a communal venture to suppress or undermine the very serious tragedy of the pandemic, instead this is a communal effort to heal. 
                                        By sharing beautiful visuals and perspectives, we hope to undo the some of the negatives effects the pandemic had on all of us. Just as the pandemic turned countless 
                                        lives upside down, we want to retaliate, to try in as graceful a way we can to reverse what little or as much as we can, to in response to the pandemic turn the spirit 
                                        of the virus upside down.

                                    Through my studies at Tech, I’ve enjoyed learning how to capture people’s experiences through written storytelling. UpsideDown has given me the opportunity to do that with students all across campus but exploring how to do so visually as well. I’m a firm believer that even the hardest of times are but stories that can be used to encourage and empathize with someone later.

I am fascinated about how people use technology and digital media to help cope or manage life changes.

For my own project I explored post-internet theory implementation through utilizing fractal patterns and interactive features such as filters.

                                    Katrina Horowitz is a third-year studying LMC and economics. She wanted to play with the concept of literal reflections while reflecting on some of the events of the past year. Her drawing shows the Atlanta skyline from Piedmont Park - an area which became a regular part of her life after the pandemic began - but deviates from traditional expectations by showing a reflection of the Perseverance Rover landing on Mars. By doing this, the image quite literally flips the message upside down into the reflection in the lake, reminding us all that a flip of our expectations can change the way we see the world. This past year has no doubt been hard, so it is more important than ever to celebrate the good moments, and this drawing aims to do just that.
